# SDR# R820T Improved Plugin

This is enhanced version of R820T Plugin for SDR#. This should be a in-place replace plugin fully compatible with the other `SDRSharp.R820T.dll` file.

# How to use it

Download the latest release here in github. It will include the necessary `SDRSharp.R820T.dll` and `librtlsdr.dll`

# TODO List

*   ~~Bias T Support for RTLSDR V.3 Dongles~~
*   Bandwidth Selector


I hope you enjoy it!
